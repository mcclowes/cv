### Product Director _- Codat_

_November 2021 - Ongoing_

[Codat](https://bit.ly/3ObH0e0) helps banks and fintechs build insights and automations with accounting, banking, and commerce data. Leading the service and platform teams, I have:

- Defined and delivered product vision + strategy supporting clients for spend analysis and underwriting use-cases (inc. J.P. Morgan and other major banks).
- Created best-in-class products including Codat's [Link](https://docs.codat.io/auth-flow/overview) (↑2x conversion, driving data sharing for 100,000 SMBs), [developer portal](https://docs.codat.io/configure/portal/companies) (↑40% MAUs), and award-winning [docs](https://docs.codat.io/) (↑30% faster go-lives).
- Replatformed Codat, improving efficiency, supporting enterprise-grade client needs, and improving delivery pace (e.g. deploying new webhooks ↑5x faster).
- Built cross-functional teams and nurtured high-performing PMs, engineers, designers, and technical writers. [Celebrated](https://github.com/mcclowes/mcclowes/blob/master/feedback.md) as Codat's top PM and manager, promoted swiftly several times.
- Pioneered product excellence at Codat, including data-driven methods (supported by Amplitude).
- Led more experimental initiatives including Codat's nascent AI & LLM work, a growth commercial model, and more.

### Product Manager _- Swoop_

_March 2021 - November 2021_

[Swoop](https://bit.ly/swoopfunding) is the virtual CFO helping businesses secure funding and increase efficiency. Built products that solve longstanding SMB challenges:

- Rolled out SMB self-served access to underwriting of up to £1m, improving cost to serve and reducing time-to-funds to within 24 hours (↓3 days avg. vs. ~14 days avg. previously) via loan aggregation service.
- Built credit scoring and reporting product backed by CRIF, increasing user retention (↑10%), data-sharing (↑15%), and reducing low-quality loan applications.
- Wearing a delivery and manager hat, took a team which had _never_ released in a year to shipping several major projects in quick succession.
