## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

I regularly attend PM conferences & meet-ups _(Elevate, Product School)_. I keep up to speed with PM best-practice through online learning and blogs/newsletters.

I've always got a [personal development project](https://github.com/mcclowes?tab=repositories) on the go; currently, I'm building a fantasy football team-building AI and the [tool that made this CV](https://github.com/mcclowes/cv-maker). I regularly attend developer meet-ups _(React London, GitHub Universe, Next Conf)_.

I love board games, quizzes, cryptic crosswords, and cats. I'm a runner (first marathon will be in Valencia in December), cyclist, rock climber, and dancer (1st place university circuit). I sing and am a multi-instrumentalist.
