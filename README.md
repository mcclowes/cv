<ol>
<li>A federation of 40+ London GP practices were restricted by <strong>NHS</strong> regulation and struggling with collaboration, communication, and project governance. In 2016, after thorough requirement gathering and a 3-phase build, my team delivered a bespoke private network and project management tool. It was only retired when the NHS rolled out MS Office in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Arsenal FC</strong> were looking to efficiently record and report match-day injuries. They thought they needed a bespoke data gathering and reporting system; instead, I created a simple workflow using existing free tools, which transformed their process and they still at every home game.</li>
<li>After being let down by a previous agency, travel-guide startup <strong>Cityboard</strong> had a barely-functioning iOS-only app, and little remaining runway. Under tight time and budget constraints, my team designed and delivered a beautiful, cross-platform MVP with newly-launched React Native.</li>
<li>Think-tank <strong>The Business of Cities</strong> needed a way or aggregating and analyzing indexes for their clients. Through novel use of the Elo rating algorithm, I created a methodology and tool which is <em>&quot;critical to their work&quot;</em>, providing insight to <a href="https://www.thebusinessofcities.com/partners">cities across the world</a>.</li>
<li>Traditional, premium butchers <strong>Godfreys.co</strong> had queues round the block and no online presence. I designed and project-managed a complete rebrand and award-winning eCommerce website that now brings in 30% of their revenue.</li>
